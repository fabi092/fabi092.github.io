      <p>
		In collaboration with the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (BLKA), I contributed to 
		the creation of an innovative VR tool that revolutionizes crime scene analysis and investigation.
		The VR crime scene analysis software offers lifelike representation of crime scenes for investigators equipped with VR headsets. 
      </p>

      <p>
		The application incorporates new VR control mechanisms and seamlessly integrates 3D crime scene laser scans into the Unreal Engine. 
		Aside from development of the software my responsibilities also included enhancing the scenes with crucial elements such as surveillance videos, evidence photos, 
		models of involved persons, objects, and vehicles, as well as animations depicting the sequence of events.
      </p>

      <p>
	<b>Work Details:</b><br>
    -Implemented new VR control features for intuitive user interaction, for example a VR animation handler.<br>
    -Translated 3D crime scene laser scans into the Unreal Engine for realistic representation.<br>
    -Integrated important elements like surveillance videos, evidence photos, and 3D models of persons and objects.<br>
    -Utilized "Make Human" for creating human models and adapted models of objects with Blender for use in the crime scenes.
